  <b style="font-size:24px">Data Structure ::</b></br></br>
  Data structure can be defined as the group of data elements which provides an efficient way of storing and organising data in the computer so that it can be used efficiently</br></br>
 Some <b>Examples</b> of Data Structures are arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queue, etc.</br></br>
 Data Structures are the main part of many computer science algorithms as they enable the programmers to handle the data in an efficient way. It plays a vital role in enhancing the performance of a software or a program as the main function of the software is to store and retrieve the user's data as fast as possible.

  <b style="font-size:24px">Basic Terminology ::</b></br></br>
  Data structures are the building blocks of any program or the software</br></br>
 <b style="font-size:20px">Data : </b>Data can be defined as an elementary value or the collection of values, for example, student's name and its id are the data about the student.</br></br>
<b style="font-size:20px">Group Items : </b>Data items which have subordinate data items are called Group item, for example, name of a student can have first name and the last name.</br></br>
<b style="font-size:20px">Record : </b>Record can be defined as the collection of various data items, for example, if we talk about the student entity, then its name, address, course and marks can be grouped together to form the record for the student.</br>
</br>
<b style="font-size:20px">File : </b>A File is a collection of various records of one type of entity, for example, if there are 60 employees in the class, then there will be 20 records in the related file where each record contains the data about each employee.</br></br>
<b style="font-size:20px">Attribute and Entity : </b>An entity represents the class of certain objects. it contains various attributes. Each attribute represents the particular property of that entity.
</br></br>
<b style="font-size:20px">Field : </b>Field is a single elementary unit of information representing the attribute of an entity

  <b style="font-size:24px">Abstract Data Structure ::</b></br></br>
  Abstract Data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behaviour is defined by a set of value and a set of operations.</br></br>
The definition of ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented. It does not specify how data will be organized in memory and what algorithms will be used for implementing the operations. It is called “abstract” because it gives an implementation-independent view. The process of providing only the essentials and hiding the details is known as abstraction.</br></br>
The user of data type does not need to know how that data type is implemented, for example, we have been using Primitive values like int, float, char data types only with the knowledge that these data type can operate and be performed on without any idea of how they are implemented. So a user only needs to know what a data type can do, but not how it will be implemented. Think of ADT as a black box which hides the inner structure and design of the data type.</br></br>

  <b style="font-size:24px">Time Complexity ::</b></br></br>
Time complexity is a type of computational complexity that describes the time required to execute an algorithm. The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time it takes for each statement to complete. As a result, it is highly dependent on the size of the processed data.</br></br>
<b>For Example ::</b>Time complexity of some searching and sorting.

 <p>
  <b style="font-size:24px">Space Complexity ::</b>
  </br></br>
  Space Complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input.</br></br>
  <b>For Example ::</b>Space complexity of some searching and sorting.

 <p>
  <b style="font-size:24px">Primitive Data Structure ::</b></br></br>
 Primitive data structure is a kind of data structure that stores the data of only one type.</br></br>
  <b>For Example ::</b>Integer, float ,char ,etc.
 </p>
 <hr style="height:2px;background-color:black">
 <p>
<b style="font-size:24px">Non-Primitive Data Structure ::</b></br></br>
Non-primitive data structure is a type of data structure that can store the data of more than one type.</br></br>
<b>For Example ::</b>Array ,stack ,Linked List ,etc.
 </p>
 <hr style="height:2px;background-color:black">
 <p>
     <b style="font-size:24px">Linear Data Structure ::</b></br></br>
  A linear data structure is a structure in which the elements are stored sequentially, and the elements are connected to the previous and the next element. As the elements are stored sequentially, so they can be traversed or accessed in a single run. The implementation of linear data structures is easier as the elements are sequentially organized in memory. The data elements in an array are traversed one after another and can access only one element at a time.</br></br>
     <b>For Example ::</b>Array ,Queue ,Stack ,Linked List.
 </p>
 <hr style="height:2px;background-color:black">
 <p>
     <b style="font-size:24px">Non-Linear Data Structure ::</b></br></br>
   A non-linear data structure is also another type of data structure in which the data elements are not arranged in a contiguous manner. As the arrangement is nonsequential, so the data elements cannot be traversed or accessed in a single run. In the case of linear data structure, element is connected to two elements (previous and the next element), whereas, in the non-linear data structure, an element can be connected to more than two elements.</br></br>
     <b>For Example ::</b> Trees and Graphs .

 <p>
     <b style="font-size:24px">Static Data Structure ::</b></br></br>
   A Static Data Structure is an organization or collection of data in memory that is fixed in size. This results in the maximum size needing to be known in advance, as memory cannot be reallocated at a later point.</br></br>
     <b>For Example ::</b> Array 
 </p>
 <hr style="height:2px;background-color:black">
 <p>
     <b style="font-size:24px">Dynamic Data Structure ::</b></br></br>
  A Dynamic data structures are designed to facilitate change of data structures in the run time. Static Data structure has fixed memory size whereas in Dynamic Data Structure, the size can be randomly updated during run time which may be considered efficient with respect to memory complexity of the code.</br></br>
     <b>For Example ::</b>Trees ,Queue ,Stack .
